			<h2>How do we Solve Water Pollution?</h2>
			<p>Water pollution endangers ecosystems, health, and economies. Effective solutions require coordinated actions such as:</p>
			
				<b>Improve Wastewater Treatment</b>
				<p>Upgrade systems with advanced technologies like membrane filtration and biological treatments to remove chemicals 
				and pathogens from sewage and industrial waste. Properly treated water protects ecosystems and reduces health risks.
				</p>
				<b>Reduce Plastic Pollution</b>
				<p>Minimize single-use plastics by encouraging biodegradable alternatives and improving recycling systems.
				Cleanup campaigns help remove plastic waste from rivers and oceans, preventing harm to marine life.
				</p>
				<b>Sustainable Agriculture</b>
				<p>Adopt eco-friendly farming practices to reduce runoff of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farming, 
				vegetative buffer zones near water bodies, and precision techniques can significantly lower water contamination.
				</p>
				<b>Stormwater Managemente</b>
				<p>Stormwater carries pollutants from urban areas into water bodies. Green infrastructure like rain gardens, retention basins, and 
				permeable pavements can filter out contaminants and reduce waterway pollution.
				</p>
				<b>Public Awareness</b>
				<p>Educating communities about water conservation and pollution prevention fosters accountability. 
				Organized cleanups and public campaigns encourage collective responsibility and behavior change.
				</p>
				<b>Stronger Policies</b>
				<p>Governments must enforce laws on waste disposal, regulate industrial/agricultural practices, and incentivize sustainable technologies. 
				Penalties for violations and subsidies for eco-friendly innovations are critical.

				Combining technology, policy, and public effort can restore water quality, protect ecosystems, and ensure a sustainable future
