        <h2>What are the Effects of Water Pollution?</h2>
        <p>
            Water pollution is a pressing global issue that 
            affects not only the environment but also human 
            health and economies. Contaminated water sources
            are a leading cause of waterborne diseases such 
            as cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, which claim 
            thousands of lives annually, particularly in 
            regions lacking access to clean water. Beyond 
            immediate health impacts, long-term exposure to 
            polluted water can lead to chronic illnesses, 
            including neurological disorders and cancers, 
            significantly burdening healthcare systems and communities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The food chain is another victim of water pollution. Pollutants such as
            heavy metals, pesticides, and microplastics accumulate in aquatic organisms,
            including fish and shellfish, which are then consumed by humans. This 
            bioaccumulation of toxins not only poses severe health risks but also 
            threatens food security. Furthermore, the tourism and recreational sectors 
            suffer from water pollution, as degraded water quality diminishes the aesthetic
            appeal of natural landscapes, reducing visitor numbers and associated economic benefits.</p>
