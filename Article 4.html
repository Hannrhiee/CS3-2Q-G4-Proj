        <h2>How Do We Solve Water Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Water pollution endangers ecosystems, health, and economies. Effective solutions require coordinated actions such as:</p>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Improve Wastewater Treatment</b>
            <p>Upgrade systems with advanced technologies like membrane filtration and biological treatments to remove chemicals 
               and pathogens from sewage and industrial waste. Properly treated water protects ecosystems and reduces health risks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Reduce Plastic Pollution</b>
            <p>Minimize single-use plastics by encouraging biodegradable alternatives and improving recycling systems.
               Cleanup campaigns help remove plastic waste from rivers and oceans, preventing harm to marine life.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Sustainable Agriculture</b>
            <p>Adopt eco-friendly farming practices to reduce runoff of pesticides and fertilizers. Organic farming, 
               vegetative buffer zones near water bodies, and precision techniques can significantly lower water contamination.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Stormwater Management</b>
            <p>Stormwater carries pollutants from urban areas into water bodies. Green infrastructure like rain gardens, retention basins, and 
               permeable pavements can filter out contaminants and reduce waterway pollution.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Public Awareness</b>
            <p>Educating communities about water conservation and pollution prevention fosters accountability. 
               Organized cleanups and public campaigns encourage collective responsibility and behavior change.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <b>Stronger Policies</b>
            <p>Governments must enforce laws on waste disposal, regulate industrial/agricultural practices, and incentivize sustainable technologies. 
               Penalties for violations and subsidies for eco-friendly innovations are critical.
