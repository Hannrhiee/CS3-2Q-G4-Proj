			<h2>What are the Effects of Water Pollution?</h2>
			<p>Without adequate water quality, we are destroying not only our environment but also our health. 
			Water contamination comes with a multitude of health risks, including the spread of waterborne diseases 
			and long-term health complications that will lead to many more deaths. Fishing in polluted water also contaminates 
			our food chain and induces toxins in the food that we eat. Additionally, water pollution can also have detrimental effects on ecosystems. 
			It also ruins the aesthetic and values of our landscape, impacting tourism and the overall quality of life in affected areas. 
			Poor water quality promotes disruption in our aquatic ecosystems, leading to a decline in biodiversity that causes the death of many marine 
			animals, such as corals.
