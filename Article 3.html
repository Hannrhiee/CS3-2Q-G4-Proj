			<h2>Avoid Water Pollution</h2>
			<p>Avoiding water pollution is crucial to our environment, as it reduces the risks of harming aquatic life and our overall water quality. 
			We should maintain proper waste management practices and avoid using harmful chemicals that can seep into our water sources. 
			Let us start by avoiding draining certain products into our sinks, such as oils and chemicals, that will lead to no further contamination. 
			Plastic waste is one major cause of water pollution that we can also address by reducing our use of single-use plastics and being mindful of 
			our plastic waste to prevent it from going into our waterways.
